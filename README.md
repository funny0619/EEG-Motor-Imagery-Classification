# EEG Motor Imagery Classification
CNN-LSTM to classify EEG signals based on motor imagery. Morlet Wavelet Transform was used for preprocessing as outlined in [Construction of a Morlet Wavelet Power Spectrum](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1013847512432) for feature extraction of EEG Signals. [Emotion Recognition based on EEG using LSTM](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/11/15/2387) was referenced for the construction of the model.

# EEG data
The EEG data represents what letter of the alphabet the subject was thinking of drawing. The data has 801 time points and 24 channels.
